# SRCNN

I implemented NN,bilinear,bicubic,frequency-domain and SRCNN as a term project in the Digital Image Processing class on campus. 



With the recent proliferation of Full HD (1920X1080) and Ultra HD (3840x2,160) displays, it is important to convert the size of past vast SD (640x480) 
class images to that resolution. Therefore, we converted it into various techniques and compared and analyzed it with PSNR figures.

 Nearest Neighbor, Bilinar, and Bicubic were directly implemented, and the SRCNN technique, a deep learning technology, was recently applied. In addition, all results were compared with PSNR figures.
